# Reactive-Game-Server-Platform

Where does an idea to build a Reactive Game Server Platform come from? It comes from a bunch of realworld requirements.

### Requirements

- A Big Data ready game server
  * Covered full Big Data pipeline which include data acquision, transformation, analysis, decision/visualization. 
- Game server as a Reactive system.
  * Support higher massive amount of Online Player
  * Good response time
  * Higher Availability
  * Higher Scalability requirement
  * Automatic Failover and Self-Healing
  * Naturely Cload ready
- Application level load balancing.
  * No dummy network level load balancing
- Extremely developer friendly.
  * No enigmatic concept ( Resilient, Elastic, Asynchronize, Non-blocking etc.)
  * Fill in the blank: a skeleton/frame/structure onto which game developer put "flesh".


### Let's running to the future, hAkker gamers!
