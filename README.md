# Reactive-Game-Server-Platform

Where does an idea to build a Reactive Game Server Platform come from? It comes from a bunch of realworld requirements.

### Requirements

- A Big Data ready game server
  * Covered full Big Data pipeline which include data acquision, transformation, analysis, decision/visualization. 
  * Lambda architecture: Fast Data + Batched Data
  * Injection sensor on Client side and Server side.
- Game server built in Reactive way.
  * Support high massive amount of Online Player
  * Good response time
  * High Availability
  * High Scalability
  * Automatic Failover and Self-Healing
  * Naturely Cload ready
  * Non-blocking and asynchronous 
  * Built on Reactive Stream
- A Lambda style game server
  * Scalable Functions
  * Simple API
  * Simple Function Life-cycle
  * built on IOC
- Microservices with Lambda Functions
- Application level load balancing.
  * No dummy network level load balancing
- Extremely developer friendly.
  * No enigmatic concept ( Resilient, Elastic, Asynchronize, Non-blocking etc.)
  * Fill in the blank: a skeleton/frame/structure onto which game developer put "flesh".
